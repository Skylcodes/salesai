More context. You're a producer, music producer who came through my uh my content. Very warm. Um it's inbound. Watched the VSSL and just booked a call. >> Cool. Let's do it. >> Hey, is this Andreas? >> Uh speaking. >> Perfect, brother. It's Antar. How are you doing? >> Doing good, dude. What about you? >> Oh, good, bro. I saw that you booked a call about like possible help building your brand as a producer. So, um walk me through what you what exactly you need help with, man. >> I'm honestly just looking to kind of get more streams on my on my songs. And so I I heard you had sick beats. So yeah, just kind of seeing what we can do together. >> Now pause. That doesn't make sense. You're a producer who's trying to be like me serving artists, not an artist. >> Yeah. I don't know the [ __ ] anything about this industry. So I'm a producer >> and I'm trying to be like a version of you where you give beats to other people. So you're basically selling a coaching. >> Exactly. I'm coaching. Yeah. Coach. Okay. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. >> Yeah. >> Where do you start? >> Yeah. I saw that you booked a call about possible help building your brand. Is that right? Uh yeah. Yeah, that was me. >> Perfect, brother. What exactly you need help with? >> Um yeah, dude. Honestly, looking to kind of like get my beats in front of more people and stuff and so different artists. So yeah, just looking to Yeah. >> And what have you seen that makes you feel that you need a brand to get your beats out there? >> Well, I'm saying I know like there there's some help with like experience. I can tell obviously you guys have a lot of that. So >> what do you mean? What do you mean experience? >> Oh, like for me? >> No, no, like you Yeah, like you get connection and stuff like that. >> Okay. But like for you though, what are you doing right now to get placements like to work with bigger artists? just calling you feel like, man, I need to to build a brand >> on outreach cementing. >> Uh-huh. How long you been doing outreach? >> It's been I mean like on and off a year. >> A year? >> Yeah. >> Okay. Why'd you do that? >> It's kind of intuitive. It's like why don't you reach more people? So, let me outreach them. >> Yeah. Okay. And do you like it though? Like besides not getting any [ __ ] artists to respond to you, do you like the the way that the strategy you're using right now to work with artists? >> I like it. It's okay. What do you like about it, brother? >> I don't know. Like, it's it's it's simple, you know what I mean? Like I sometimes they respond, sometimes they don't. I get some some good conversations. >> How many like how many uh artists are you connected to at the moment? >> Um I would say I don't know, like two or three. >> 20? >> No, like two or three. >> Uh that's not a problem. I mean, you've been doing it for a year, so still early on. Um so far so good. How do you think? >> Continue from here because this is the part where it gets choppy. I have one piece of feedback, but this is the part where it get choppy. So, continue. >> Perfect, bro. So, is it more about like, you know, connecting with more audience or about like changing the way that you're u I guess changing the way that you're getting these connections right now. If you could though, >> um I would just want to be able to reach more people. >> What do you mean? >> Like, I want to like get in front of more like artists. >> How many more artists, brother? as many as possible. >> Yeah. Quantify for me. >> I got I don't know like five a month. Something like that. >> Five a month. Okay. And um Yeah. Pause. Well, >> what are you pausing for? >> What do I say now? >> From there. You lost. You don't know what to say from there. >> Yeah. I wanted to probe like meaning, but I I uh >> Okay. So, two things. Number one. Okay. So, the question this will be insanely good for you. This is the same question as for Jacob, right? Insanely good for you. You can go. So I guess like in the conversations you're having like when you're reaching out then what's I guess like happening that's preventing you from being able to like actually connect with them >> right >> cuz then they have to go oh well they're ghosting me how long has that been going on for impact that's very easy oh man well they're just closed off they already have like a producer how long has that been going on for impact exact same thing that's number one that question will break them open number two you need to make it a lot more clear what answer you're trying to get in basis of your tone. For example, if I go, "Do you like him?" It's like I want them to say they like it. But if I go like, "Do do you like 100% like it?" >> It's like obvious. I want him to say no. Like I'm directing the question. >> Mhm. >> Does that make sense? >> Yeah. Right. I use the upward infliction like what do you like about it? It's supposed to be here like upward inflection there, not >> so the issue right now isn't the inflections, it's the tonality. You're not doing any tonality. And even a layer deeper than that, it's the body language. So your body language will controls your tenonity. You're not doing any of it. >> Okay. >> So if I tell you right now, like ask me how long I've been doing something for. >> How long you been doing it that way or like you're kind of doing outreach and to getting more artists? >> It's been like two years, something like that. >> Two years. Okay, nice. And how many uh how many placements you got so far? >> I have like I don't know like two a month or something like that. Like small artist stuff. >> That's crazy. Okay. Uh you said 20. >> Two a month. Two a month. Oh, >> okay. That's not a problem. Um, and yeah, what do you think of that here? >> I was like, okay, right there, that's not a problem. Like, what the [ __ ] does that mean? That's not a problem. >> Versus if if I go like, ah, it's okay, bro. Like, we all start somewhere. You know what I mean? >> That's very different, right? So, like, you just need to exaggerate your This is the exact same thing I was doing this morning. You need to exaggerate your tone a lot deeper to make them feel the impact. >> So, like try this. You You also skipped a question. That's what I was going to judge you off of, but you're supposed to ask what caused you to do XYZ. So, try this. Ask the how long have you been doing XYZ for? I'm going to give you an answer. And when you ask the what caused you to do it, intentionally use a skeptical tone. What is a skeptical tone? You lean back and you scrunch your eyebrows. What caused you to like do it that way? >> Okay, >> that's skeptical. And exaggerate like phys like physically move back and scrunch your eyebrows. >> I got >> Okay, cool. Try it. Do that one. How long you been doing it that way with like reaching out to artists hoping hoping they respond? >> It's been like two years something like that. >> What caused you to do it that way? >> I don't know. It was just kind of like easy. Do it again. >> Okay. And how long you been doing it that way with like um reaching out to artists? >> Two years. Something like that. >> Two. What caused you to do it that way? >> Way better. >> Way better already. Now try this. When you're asking the what caused you to do or when you're asking the how long, fill your head, squint your eyes, curious how how long you been doing like doing it that way. >> Okay. And how long you been doing that way like with the with the reach out? >> Start start from what approach are you using and then do those three questions. >> Okay. And brother like what are you doing right now like to work with artists that's causing you feel like man I'm not I'm not getting any placements. >> You just completely forgot the curious test. >> Yeah. I mean that was the next question, right? That was a >> No, but they're both they're both supposed to be curious. Uhhuh. Okay. >> What are you doing now? That's also curious. >> Okay. And what are you right now? That's like um to get placements that's causing you to feel like, man, I'm lost. >> Not bad. But at the end, you undid it. You started it, right? What are you doing now that caus you to feel like you're not getting placements? And it was just direct. >> Uhhuh. >> Versus what are you doing now that I guess like you feel is causing you like not to get placements? >> Okay. >> I'm more curious. So, pause because we can't do it too many times obviously. Practice on your own. Another thing, and this is a note for you, whenever you're doing it, the only time when you tilt your head and squint your eyes, you always have one shoulder up like this because it makes it feel more natural or like less awkward for you because you're not used to it. >> Force yourself not to do that. So, force yourself in a neutral body position and then just tilt. How long you been doing that for? >> Okay. >> Force it out of yourself and just do it over and over. That's your one thing is just that making it sound natural from there. And then also that question I gave you earlier, you can use that to like crack them up. >> Yeah. Okay. Perfect. So, I my main focus right now is tonality. Just fix that right now. >> Body language. >> I got you. Thank you, brother. >> Cool. Beautiful. Jacob, go for it. >> Yeah. I know you introduced me to like the what shifter question now. Um should I still be asking like after that one like what's happening in this conversation that's causing you to feel X Y and Z? >> You can that that's really just a way to crack people open. So, for example, if I go what's shifted and they go, oh man, well, like I'm just not getting dates. >> That's pretty surface level, >> right? Right. >> So, if I want to go a little bit deeper, then I can go, well, like what what's actually happening in the conversations, though? It's like you're going to get the dates. >> Mhm. >> Oh, well, they chased me off. I got to know whatever the [ __ ] they say, right? It's like you use that to go like a layer deeper. But if you ask what shifted and they go, "Oh, dude. Well, I don't know. Like, every girl in the world [ __ ] hates me and I want to kill myself." Like, you can kind of move on. You don't really >> meaning meaning how long impact. >> Yeah. Exactly. >> Okay. And then for the what's shifted now, should I replace that entirely for like do you like it for like all the conversations or just like based on how engaged they are? >> Um, let me think for you. You could replace it in so Okay, do this at the beginning. Try like 50/50 split test it. If the what's question sounds natural for you and you know it working, just do it in every conversation. >> Okay, >> cool. >> Yeah. Do you want to do a role play? >> Sweet. Go for it. Start from not from the beginning. Start from um what like what approach are you using? Start from there. >> Okay. But what was the intent? >> I'm not I'm not I'm not getting enough dates. >> I'm not getting enough dates. >> So So what's kind of like the current approach you have been using now to like try and set up dates that's causing you to not get as many as you want. >> I mean I like I don't know like dating apps and stuff that say. >> Okay. Okay. in the dating apps, like how long has that been sort of like the approach you have been taking to like date? >> I don't know, like six months, something like that. >> Okay. And how's that been going for you lately? >> It's going like okay, like something crazy, you know what I mean? >> Okay. So, what what actually like shifted now that made you want to have more that, you know, strategy in place rather than just continue doing it on your own? Um, I would say like I kind of realized like I I want to start like taking dating a little bit more seriously and like find a girlfriend. So, >> meaning meaning what? >> When you say more seriously? >> Yeah. Like go on more dates with more people. >> Gotcha. So, what's actually like happening in those conversations that's causing you to feel like you're not able to get as many dates as you want? >> Well, okay, pause. It's not what's happening in the conversations that's that you feel is causing you not to get as many dates. You [ __ ] up the question. >> Yeah. >> What's happening in the conversations that you feel is causing Okay. >> Just reassess it. Ask it again. >> So So what's actually happening in the conversations that you feel is causing you to to not get many dates? >> No, it's not what's happening the conversations that you feel is causing you not to get many dates. It's what's happening in the conversation that isn't allowing you to get many dates. >> Oh, say that again. >> What's happening in conversations that's causing you not to be able to get many dates? >> Causing you to be able to not get Okay. Okay. So, what's happening in the conversation that's causing you to not be able to get as many dates? >> Well, I mean, like it just never really goes anywhere. >> Meaning >> like I don't know, we'll go on like one date or something, but then we never go like out again. >> Got you. And so like you like getting ghosted by these girls like after first date. Like how long have you been noticing that that's happening? >> Well, I just you can't assume. I didn't say it was ghosted. >> Okay. Should I ask? >> If you if you say that in a call, it's going to trigger a lot of resistance like a [ __ ] >> Okay. >> It's because of your offer. Like it's unfortunate, but it is what it is. >> Okay. Okay. Are you are you getting ghosted or like what do you mean that the second day is going nowhere? >> Um well like it just doesn't kind of like go anywhere. I don't I don't know. like we just never go out again. >> Okay. So, like how long you been noticing like the first day is kind of like where it ends and it goes nowhere else besides that >> past six months. >> Okay. And now just going to impact question. >> Yeah. It's not bad. Um one thing you need to be careful about what's shifted question you need to pause a little bit better to get a deeper impact. So like rather like for example if you look at the way you asked it like okay ask it to me real quick. So what shifted now that made you want to have like that proper strategy in place rather than that you just continue doing it on on your own? >> Oh yeah, that versus like so the question before was what kind of results have you gotten or whatever like how's it been going for you? and I said, "Oh, it's going decent." Then my what shifted question be like, I mean, it doesn't it's going like went terrible. Then I guess is there like I guess what kind of shifted for you recently then as you look for I guess like more of an advanced way to really like start going on more dates and like speaking with more women rather than just kind of like keep doing what you've been doing. Why don't you do that? So my pausing is a lot more intentional and I'm also justifying for them. It doesn't sound like it's going terrible. What shifted recently? >> Does that make sense? >> Yeah, it does. It does. >> Difference. So just watch the recording, see the delivery. I also would not and the last thing I also would not ask the question of how's that been going for you before what shifted because that'll defeat a lot of the purpose. >> Okay. Should I stick to like what caused you to >> Yeah. Okay. >> For what shifted you have to do what what caused >> because it'll see doubt and then you go what shifted. >> What would be a mirror question for like what caused like why that way? >> Yeah. Or that way. >> Okay. >> Cool. Sweet. Arian, go for it. Andress, uh, first thing, thank you for showing up today even though you're sick and you're coughing up blood, man. I really appreciate it. So, a couple things. Well, two things. What I really want to quickly role play in the 10th phase cuz I I want to respect people's time and I also want to address an issue I had today where I was basically trying to clear money logistical and basically the the prospect wasn't really open or from what I understood he wasn't what I perceived he wasn't really open and I assumed it was a it was a value issue. I'd gone to that got into the value kind of objection handling and then what ended up happening is we had to close off the call. So there's two there's two primary things I wanted to do and I I wanted to do intent first. >> Cool. So I first I do I sell basically fitness coaching for executives and entrepreneurs. So just to give you a bit more information. So awesome. Hey, can you hear me and see me? >> Yeah, I can. >> Awesome man. How are you doing? >> I'm good. I'm good. What about you? >> Awesome. Good. Good. Let's go ahead and dive right in. From what I understand, we're on this call so that I can help point you in the right direction in order to lose weight, get in better shape so you can avoid any health issues in the future, and also look the way you want. Is that correct? >> Yeah. Yeah, that's why I'm here. >> Awesome. So, what do you feel like you need the most help with in regards to a fitness strategy, whether it's the the diet, the regime, or the time efficiency so you can lose that weight and get better shape? >> I would say probably the diet is the main thing. >> Okay. And what have you seen that makes you feel like you're not having the right diet? >> Well, I mean I like I go to the gym pretty consistently and stuff, so I kind of have to assume that like the diet's really the only other thing it could be. >> Okay. And what what do you do exactly for your diet right now? >> Well, I mean I guess not much. Like I I go to the grocery store, cook some meals, probably more than that. >> Okay. And in regards to the results you're getting, like how much weight are you losing per per month? >> Losing probably like a pound a month, two pounds a month. >> Okay. And is that the is that the primary reason why you feel like the diet is a main issue? >> I would say yeah, I'd say so. Yeah, because that's kind of what I'm trying to fix. >> Okay. How was that? I I wasn't sure if I got the proper past experience. you so you kind you kind of went to like a [ __ ] like middle ground whenever you asked um what's it called when you asked me the question of what have you seen and then I told you oh well like my fitness is fine but I feel like my my diet is like like that's the only other thing it could be because my fitness is fine then I would have asked one more question I would have gone like so what do you notice with your diet that I guess you feel could like potentially be the problem >> okay so problem what they specifically say is a problem >> yeah I would say that and then even if I didn't give you an answer I still would have gone logical certainty and then follow it from there. The issues after logical certainty, you kind of detract it. You didn't go down sequence and all other stuff. >> In regards to the what are you seen when we're looking for a particular answer is there are we trying to verify like what they've seen in regards to their progress that's telling them or that's making them be feel like they're not having the proper >> your only goal so people don't understand this. Your only goal with experience is to get them to think to the past and give you a problem. >> Okay? So it doesn't matter what they what they specifically say. >> Does not matter. I don't give a [ __ ] It's a problem and I need them to think to the past. That's it. Because very often they'll think of a problem and they just won't tell me. Like have you ever been in a conversation with a buddy of yours or something and they say something and you have a specific opinion or a thought or maybe it's even a stranger you met or your family member and you have some opinion about it but you don't tell them >> but you were still thinking it. >> You're like in your mind you're like this dude's a [ __ ] idiot. >> But you don't say it to them. That's essentially what you're doing to them except instead of them thinking you're a [ __ ] idiot, they're thinking about the problem. >> Okay, got it. Got it. So, it's really getting an I'm going to use I'm going to use that more often. >> Think about it, focus on it essentially. That's the goal of that particular question. Okay, perfect. And then the second thing I want to go over really quick is I had a basically I was trying to clear money logistical. I have the recording and I've been basically rewriting my the the whole script until objection handling and I I kind of felt like I didn't know what to do when he when he wasn't giving the answer about building those expenses aside. What can he what can he give? Right? What can he invest into his health? >> So, should I play the recording really quick? >> Um yeah, sure. Hold up. >> Okay. >> Yeah. >> I think I already know what the problem is. >> Actually, wait. >> I can verify. >> Should I should I basically Yeah. Let me see if you can hear it. Can you hear it? >> I can't hear [ __ ] >> Okay, give me a sec. >> You know what to tell me what happened. I can tell you what the issue is. I'm pretty sure I already know this. >> Yeah. Basically, I was trying to clear money logistical and he kind of >> Yeah, I was saying so basically I said those are expensive side. What do you have to invest in in your health? First, >> that's issue. That's issue >> already. Okay. >> You don't say bills and expenses aside, what do you have to invest? >> Because if they have 20 grand, if they have a bad mentality, oh, I have $500 to invest. >> Oh, that was the issue cuz he said he doesn't have anything particularly dedicated towards the fitness you're right now. >> Exactly. Yeah. See, I already knew that's what it was going to [ __ ] be. Yeah. No, it's not bills and expenses aside what you have to invest. It's bills and expenses a decide what you have saved up. Oh, >> and even if they're a very hesitant prospect, I'll literally go, "Okay, so like for you, man, bills and expenses aside for a second, what do you have saved up? Like obviously you're not going to invest that. Like what do you have saved up at the moment?" So we can kind of build a plan. >> Yeah. Cuz even before that, he was like telling me this would absolutely work for me, especially because it's a location independent approach. It's just fine to me why it work for him. And like he said, you would guaranteed work for him, but right now he doesn't have any money aside particularly towards his hell. >> So >> yeah, that's the issue. So yeah, that that's why I would go again and if you know he's very hesitant, it's an expensive side. What do you have saved up? I'm not saying you're going to invest that, but what do you have saved? They're going to invest every [ __ ] dollar, but they don't know that yet. You know what I mean? Just ask them that. They'll give you an answer this, this, and that. And you can go to what's riskier. >> So that's a particular issue that I I I probably had. Yeah. Okay. >> Yeah. >> Got it. Thank you. Appreciate it. >> Cool. >> Beautiful. Daniel, go for it. >> Yo, Andreas, man, how are you? >> Good, bro. Not good, but >> Yeah. What about you? >> Cool, man. >> Yeah, I'm good, man. Yeah. Can we just do a quick role play? I think last time you told me was I was [ __ ] speaking too fast, so I'll focus on that. And um can we do like you're looking to get into like remote sales? >> Yeah, let's do it. >> Cool, man. Okay. Hey, man. Can you see me? >> Yeah. Yeah, I can. >> Cool, man. Well, it looks like you booked a time getting some possible like getting into remote sales. Is that about right? >> Yeah. Yeah, I do that. >> So, how can I help, man? >> Um, yeah, dude. Just looking for a way to kind of like get into the industry. I've seen some videos online, stuff like that. So just looking for different resources. >> Okay. And like what do you feel like you need help with like specifically I guess in order to like make that transition. >> I'd say my skill set. >> Mhm. Well, what have you seen that makes you feel like you you don't have the right skill set like now though? >> Pause. Okay. You [ __ ] up. You took the wrong approach. So there's there's two paths. There's a little thing. You can fix this easily. There's two paths. If it's something somebody's already doing, you ask what in specific. >> If it's something new that they've never done, you ask what's your intent? So in this case, have I done remote sales in the past? The prospect does explain? No. >> So you go, what's your intent? So it's like just understand what's even your intent behind looking to like possibly get high to get sales. Like what do you I guess going to get out of it? >> Oh, I want money. I want time freedom. I want location freedom. What have you seen experience? >> Okay. Because now instead of like the specifically thing, you would want the >> exact one. >> So just start from there. Just start with the entire >> what you say. I say, um, >> what's your intent behind, it's on the script as well, so look at it after. What's your intent behind looking to possibly get into XYZ? >> Okay. Uh, so should we just go from there? Yeah. >> Yeah. >> So, so what's your intent be uh, so what's your intent behind possibly getting into like remote sales? >> Yeah, just looking to make more money, man. That's the main thing. >> Well, what have you seen that makes you feel like you're not making enough money now, though? Um, I mean like I have my 9 to five job, right? Like it covers the bills, but I don't really have like a ton left over after that. >> So, sorry now like where do you work? >> I'm an engineer. >> Uh, and and how long have you been like being an engineer for? >> It's been what like three years, four years. >> And and what kind of like caused you to start working there like like in the first place? >> It was honestly it was more of a comfort thing because my whole family are engineers. It was just kind of like easy making that transition. >> Mhm. Yeah, I got you, man. So, so like do you like it at least? Like I guess besides obviously uh like not making the money you want to make, I guess. Do you like like working there? >> I like it. Say it's pretty cool. >> What do you like about it, man? >> It's just kind of like easy, I guess. It is not very complex. There's not a lot to it. >> So, it's kind of like like comfortable for you. >> Yeah. Yeah. I'd say that's a good way to put it. >> Okay. So, it doesn't sound like terrible then. I guess is there anything you would change about like the the results you're getting or kind of like the job itself like if you could though? >> I would make more money. It's really it >> like like me like meaning like what are you currently making at the moment? >> Make like 100 grand a year. >> 100 grand a year. Okay, man. So in about like six months time, what do you want to be making? >> Um I would say like 200 grand a year. >> Okay. kind of double it. Okay. Um, what would that like extra like, you know, 100k a year kind of allow you to do? >> I mean, like it' be more money, you know what I mean? >> Uh, okay, man. So, um, like how many hours would you say you're working like per day? >> Like eight, nine. >> Okay. Okay. Eight or nine. So, like typically like what's the dayto-day look like, man? >> It's pretty chill. Like I go to the office, have a coffee, >> write some code, >> eat. Am I about am I [ __ ] like digging into the right thing or is that kind of like a tangent I took? No, I was actually really curious for you, but I go with that. >> Yeah, [ __ ] >> I was more curiosity than anything. Um, so after you get that initial answer like I want money, time, location, >> you're always going to get a deeper reason why. >> Yeah. Yeah. >> The way you do that, you ask the right question. Why is that so important to you? But if I don't give you an answer, you can't move on. >> That's true. Yeah. Yeah. >> You mirror to get it. So if I say, oh, well, like it would give me more money, man. And it's like, yeah, but like I'm assuming your goal in life is to just have like more zeros in a bank account. Like what would it actually do for you? Having a little bit more money. Like is it more kind of the time aspect or like what for you? >> They say, "Oh, I could travel more. I could do this." So So I I guess you you can't do that now. >> Oh no, I can't. Well, why not? How long has that been going on for impact? Same thing. You're pretty much good up to there. The other thing this other note I was going to say, your pacing and your tone needs to change depending on the question you're asking. And during the whole thing, it wasn't terrible, but in that part is where it became noticeable. So if I'm asking the question of why is that so important to you, I can't have the same like jittery tonality like why why and then like getting lost in the [ __ ] mess. No, like there needs to be like an actual outcome for the question be very clear >> very concise, right? So for example, I could go like you make more money, man. Like why is why is that like so important to you like like now though? >> Oh, I could do this. I could do this. I could do that. Great. Now I have my answer. Yeah. So, was I kind of like stuttering on the [ __ ] like last part? >> Yeah. >> Okay. Okay. So, >> it it sounded natural. Like it wasn't a bad start like an unconfident stutter brain. You just need to learn how to adjust depending on like on those deeper questions. >> Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And how was like the did I slow down that time? Because I remember the first time. >> Yeah. It was way slower. That that was that was way better. Last time in was [ __ ] rushing through the whole thing. That time was it was spot up. >> Okay. Okay. Cool. Yeah. So just work on that probing actually if I can make it make sense and you know >> yeah the probing and slowing down your pacing and pausing on specific deeper questions to make them laugh. >> Okay, man. Thank you. >> Sweet. Beautiful. >> Ean, go for it, bro. >> Hey, what's up? How's it going? >> What's up, dude? >> How you doing? >> Good. Um, I got like my first like few sets on the new offer. Um, congrats. Yeah. So, the one thing though it's like a lot of them that I call it's like I haven't been really following like any process really. It's like well I know like the overall like process that they want me following on. It's like a it's like the intro. Um and then asking them what they're currently doing but a lot of the times they're like blabbing on um but then they kind of like lead themselves to like booking the call itself. Like I just like guide them and then they book it. How do I like create more of like a process within it? Like I know like the outcomes I want. I want to get like their current process um the returns that they're getting and the problem and then probe on that. But I haven't really been able to like follow that really within these calls. >> So you're saying how do you stick to a process? Is this answer your question? >> Yeah. Because a lot of the times they're like blabbing on but then they still end up like booking the call because they like I kind of guide them through it. But >> yeah, because they have interest. So okay, two main things. Number one, write your script a lot more to where like it's completely internalized because then it becomes a lot easier to cut people off because you know what to say when you cut them off. That's key. Number two, you just need to interject more. So, you need to get a lot more comfortable and a lot more natural with interjecting. >> Okay? >> Like if somebody's giving you answers that you don't want or they start rambling and stuff, you need to be very comfortable being able to be like when when you said XYZ, like what did you and then ask another question. >> Okay. So, like reference something that they said and then go on from there. >> Exactly. That's all you do. You reference switch. Reference switch. That's all you do. You go right back on the truck. >> Okay, cool. Could we role play? >> Yeah, go for it. >> Okay. Um, could you like uh talk like a lot like >> Yeah, I'll be I'll be right. >> All right. Hey, Andreas. >> Uh, yeah. Yeah. Speaking. >> Hey, Andre. It's Sean here with Gem Algo, the AI investing algorithm. How's it going? >> I'm good. What about you? >> I'm good. I'm good. Uh, well, to give you some context, you actually signed up to learn more about our quantitative AI investing algorithm. it it's the one that leverages AI in your portfolio which actually automates your investments and historically has been generating a 65% annual return that was still something you were wanting to learn more about right >> absolutely >> all right well I'm curious man what what kind of investment vehicles have you currently been deploying capital with >> uh mainly cryptos it's kind of the main thing I have a little bit in like real estate and stuff like that but I would say crypto is kind of the main thing because obviously a lot of returns over the last couple of like months and years. Obviously, Bitcoin's like gone down and and back up. Are you using >> Are you using a financial advisor or trading manually for that? >> Okay, that's the issue. What did you just reference from what I said? >> Nothing. >> Nothing. So, then it sounds rude. >> But if you go Oh, but but like by the way, when you say crypto, like do you have like an adviser that's like investing into that crypto for you or you kind of doing it yourself? >> Oh, I see. So, like reference like that specific part and like mention it. >> Yeah, I just asked the exact same question you asked. The only difference is I added the context of what I said. >> Okay. >> Make sense? >> Yeah. >> That's your one thing. >> Yeah. >> That's your one thing. >> You practice it with somebody else. Like role play offline because practicing with me is not going to do anything. You already know what to do. So now if you role play with me, it'll be the same as anybody else. >> Okay. >> You know what to do now. Now practice with other people and then just nail it. Just do it over and over and over again. >> Okay. Yeah. I'll work on that then. Yeah. Appreciate it. >> Beautiful. Sweet, bro. Crush it. Yeah. Yeah. Go for it. Yeah. Hey man, can you can you hear me? >> Yeah. >> Okay. I just wanted to I just wanted to role play because yesterday you told me that like I was just using okay as like a verbal cue. So I wanted to like see if I could fix that. >> Sweet. Let's do it. >> Okay. Um fitness fitness closing. >> Okay. Go for it. >> Okay. Yeah. So um hey, is this dress? >> Uh yeah. Yeah, it is. >> Yeah. Okay. Yeah. How's it going? >> I'm good. I'm good. What about you? >> Uh I'm doing good, too. So, it looks like you booked a call yesterday to like potentially get help with like losing weight, finally getting in shape, all of that. What was your like is that is that right? >> Um, yeah, I did that. I I booked that. >> Okay. And like what was your intention behind that? What were you like hoping to get out of it? >> Um, I mean, I'd say honestly just like losing some weight and stuff. Like that's the main thing. Not much more >> for sure. And like what do you feel like you need help with in specific to lose the weight? >> Maybe diet. I'm not really sure to be honest. >> And what have you like kind of seen so far that makes you feel like your diet isn't good enough right now. >> Well, I mean I'm not sure. Like I feel like everything I'm doing fitness wise is pretty good. So I assume it kind of has to be a diet issue >> for sure. And like what's your what's your current diet right now? Do you recognize a new pattern? >> What do you mean by pattern? >> Like the new thing you're doing for the verbal cue? >> I'm doing like okay for sure. >> And what's the next word after all those verbal keys every question? >> Oh, and >> exactly. It's and when you say this and when you say that and how long have you been and this and that. So you just replaced it, but you still have the same habit. >> Okay. >> Does that make sense? >> Yeah. do what I said earlier to the other guy. As you write your questions, write the verbal cue into the question how you would do it. Because for example, if all I did was write my verbal cues and then I asked the how long question, it would be like, okay, that that makes sense. And how long you been using that for? That would be the and thing versus instead the way I do is like, oh, really? How long you been doing that for? >> I can skip the and because I wrote the verbal Q into my script. >> So like internalize the verbal Q with the question. Exactly. >> Okay. >> Exactly. Because you need to remove like replacing it doesn't do anything. It's the same thing. You're just doing a different pattern now. It's uh And okay. And for sure and. >> Okay. And like is there maybe anything else you need to work on? Like two things per week? Like maybe it's >> No, that that's that's your only thing. That's by far your only thing. That's your biggest thing by Miles. >> Okay. Yeah, for sure. And everything else is solid like good enough so far. >> Well, all like the So, okay. I want to be very clear. Whenever I roll with you guys, I see 15 different things that you do wrong. But if I pointed out all of them, I'd be a terrible coach. So, I'm pointing out the one thing that will help you the absolute most that you need to learn. And it's not as easy as you think. Like, that will probably take you at least a week for you to get it down to where you're doing the right verbal cues consistently every single time. >> Okay, I'll fix it. I'll fix it. I'll try it like next uh live. Thank you so much. >> Sweet, bro. Crush it. Angelo, go for it. >> Oh, yeah. Got it. Sorry. Sorry. My bad. I was just on my computer. I just had to go back onto the computer. >> Yeah, I don't know what's going on. >> Hello. Can you hear me? >> Yeah, it's me. It's Angela. I'm on my computer instead of my phone. >> Oh, okay. That's what you're saying. Okay. My bad. >> Okay. No, you my bad. No, I just been seeing you've been looking built in your reals, seeing if the gym's working, which is good. Uh, just quickly there, I remember we're talking about like, you know, how just a bit of context with my offer with, you know, the people that men that are going through drugs, alcohol, and all that kind of stuff. Spoke to you yesterday. >> Yeah. >> And you went through some of those questions about the financial stuff. I just wanted to see if those ones I rewrote them a little bit in a way to make a little bit conversational. Can are you able to just double check if they are conversational? >> Yeah. For >> sure. >> Awesome. One sec. >> Well, don't put it up on a script. Assume it's conversational. Role play with me. I'll be the prospect and show me how you do it cuz that's the only way for me to conver. >> Okay. So, I'll just go from the transition where it gets like the financial qualification. >> Sweet. >> Okay. Okay. Great. And I know on the form you filled out a rough estimate on how much these habits are costing you roughly. How much would you say you're spending per week? >> Um I'm I'm spending I'd say probably 200 bucks a month or two 200 a week like 800 a month. >> Okay. >> Okay. And like I'm a believer in obviously more of a holistic approach obviously because like you quit like the drugs, alcohol and everything else. Now you start being able to save a lot more money. Right. >> Of course. >> Yeah. like the quality of life improves, you get in better shape, like everything kind of changes. It's kind of our goal, right? >> Yeah. >> Okay. So, I guess like for you, let's say 6 months, 6 months down the line, for example, what would you want to be in terms of like your alcohol drug use? >> Um, I mean, honestly, if I if I can, I'd want to cut it off completely. I don't want to do any of it. No more coke. >> Yeah. Great. And in terms of finances then, like 6 months from now, what would you want to be able to have saved up as a whole now that you're not spending as much on those kinds of substances? >> I mean, I'd want to I don't know. I'd want to have like 10 grand saved up or something like that, maybe. >> Okay. And how far away are you are you away from that now? >> I have like a thousand saved up. I don't really get to save a lot because like obviously spending it. >> Yeah. Okay. Sweet. Well, let's just say there was a possible way to help you get in the right support so you can go from obviously spending it quite a lot going into something to not actually doing it anymore. Would you like would you be willing to invest in yourself if that's what it took? >> Um, yeah, I'd say so. >> Okay, awesome. Now, I've got this question in here. I just wanted to ask you, would I still ask them about like what they're doing for work and how or anything like that or >> Okay, so so what what they're doing for work and all that, you shouldn't cover that in the first part of logical certainty. the root cause if you need to know it. The other thing, so the words you're saying are conversational, but you're making them not sound conversational. So you're putting like awkward pauses and stuff between them when you don't have to. Like for example, that first part of talking about like, oh, we believe in holistic approach and all that, you can say that all in a row, but you just like pause randomly like to check for like connection or something, it's not necessary. You know what I mean? >> Yes. >> Like that that's your main thing. If you just got better at saying the words themselves, it would sound very conversational. So for example, I'll show you how to do it again. I mean like hey man like we're obviously a big believer in obviously more of like a holistic approach because when you stop spending on drugs and like your your substance abuse and all that then obviously like you save a lot more money like you have more energy quality of relationships goes up finances go up like everything kind of gets better you know what I mean so I guess like for you so we kind of like set some goals and zoom out for a second where would you want to be in like say six months in terms of like kind of substance consumption alcohol drugs all that stuff do you see how much more natural that is just like all on a like it's a thought process rather than like choppy blocks. >> Yeah, >> that make sense. >> That makes complete sense. And I was also going to just quickly ask about those other two questions like we talked about yesterday about like you know the financial where they want a $150 uh refundable deposit cuz I know for a fact like you said it's silly I know but the people that don't really answer it I will just book them for myself. >> Yeah. >> Okay. So I'll just go into awesome and I see on the form you're doing X. How long have you been doing that for? I know that was the um sorry that was the what are they doing for work question and then I just go into okay well based on what I've heard man of the problem I feel like there'd be a possibility so what you said in the script is pretty much what I say then I lock in the time and date and then I go into saying the $150 refundable deposit which I don't I don't really want to say but I I will say it for that and then I'll book it for myself but then I just go into say I'm going to the last bit where I say okay it's refundable goes to the level of support of what you choose is now that just shows some level of comm commitment. Now what I do next is I'll send you a link through the text. Great. Do that. >> Okay. So do do this instead. Do this instead and just watch the transcription of this after. >> Do this. You go. So before you go into that go like and by the way like for you because obviously I'm not going to judge you. H how important is it actually for you to like figure out a way to like get off the drugs and alcohol and everything else? Like how important is it really? >> And they go oh well it's very very important. Well why? Because like I'll be real with you. The majority of people I speak to, they say like, "Oh, it's very important," etc., right? But at the end of the day, the reason they're never able to get off of it is because they never make the commitments themselves to be able to do so. So, like for you, like, why is this so important? >> Notice what I just did. I just embedded commands of for most people, it's not important enough. There needs to be enough of a commitment. >> So now, what am I going to do next? And they go, "Well, the commitment is $150." Obviously, without the words, but that's the idea. Does that make sense? So, ask those two questions >> and then you go, "So, by the way, here's what I'm going to do. I could schedule you with the owner of the company, right? Like obviously he has the most experience. He's worked with tons and tons of people. The only thing because he is so busy like he's fully booked out and everything else. Usually for those sessions it's $1,000, right? Just because it's like obviously getting rid of your addictions and all that. I mean like you mentioned earlier spending 200 bucks a week on it. You know what I mean? So he helps you get off of it. Um for you though since it's the first session, what I could do, we could do a deposit of $150 completely refundable. That's just to make sure that you like show up to that first call, right? And so again, the call is completely free. It's just a deposit to make sure that like he's not wasting his time. >> Does that make sense? That's kind of like your sign of commitment. >> Yeah. >> And they go, "Great." >> Or if they say no, because if you notice the word track I use is very intentional. What I could do is I could hook you up with the owner of the company. So now if they say no, I can say, "Okay, not a problem." Instead of of scheduling you with the owner, what we can do instead is like obviously I've been through a lot of training with X and Y and Z. You and I could schedule a call and that's a very easy transition. I like that. >> So it's like now now instead of the owner because obviously like you're not able to put the deposit instead of the owner you and I can speak. So it makes it very smooth. >> Yeah. >> Cool. >> That's absol That's absolutely amazing. And then would I still talk to them and talk about saying hey I've had some technical issues for them to pay for the $150 deposit and then because I would want a screenshot as a confirmation and then I'll just confirm the email and link and then go from there. >> Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. >> Okay. Perfect. That makes a lot of sense. That clears it up so much. Thank you so much. >> Sub, bro. >> Uh, I'm doing setting right now. So, with like some real estate agents, right? So, that's what I'm doing. >> Um, really my only question is when it comes to like I guess like handling objections, whether it's like money or like fear or something. Do you kind of still handle it like kind of like closers or or is it more of like kind of handling it off to like the the closer itself? >> You hand it off to the closer. >> Okay. >> So, you you always push it off. So, like I I talk about this all the time. Objection handling as a setter is essentially just gaslighting your prospect. That's basically all you're doing. So, you just push it off. They're like, "Oh, like how much you going to cost?" Well, I don't know, man. Like, it depends on X and Y and Z. And that's actually why we have that call because he kind of dive a lot deeper and obviously like where the business is at kind of what you want to achieve. And then in basis of that, if he feels it would be helpful, then he could obviously like suggest more advanced training like walk. Does that make sense? >> Yeah. >> They go, "Yes." Same thing for anything. What's the time commitment? Oh, well, I don't know, man. Yeah. It really depends on X and Y and Z. That's why we have the call. Blah blah blah. Right. >> Mhm. Got you. What about they keep on like asking or like really kind of like differently like asking it differently like Yeah. >> You have to hold your frame. So, okay, here's the issue. The issue is you don't believe what you're saying. >> How could you tell them the price? You don't know what [ __ ] package they should do. How can you tell them the price? >> Mhm. >> You can't. So, you got to you got to hold your [ __ ] You got to stand on it. It's like I I can't tell you, bro. I'm sorry. I don't I don't know what else to say. >> Like, you have to stand on your [ __ ] because it's real. Yeah. >> So, it's like I just keep telling them until they actually understand it. >> Mhm. >> It's like almost imagine it this way like if you were like a receptionist or something. I was about to get way too creative with that analogy. I won't say that. But all like just remember you know what it is. They don't. So, you're in control of the conversation. >> Got it. >> You don't know what the price is going to be, but you know the process. >> Mhm. >> So, you're in control. That's it. And you can loop over and over to get that same message across. >> Okay. Perfect. Awesome. >> Cool. >> Thank you. >> Sweet. Um Anastasia, go for it. Brendon will be the last one. So I got to go to the jump. >> Yeah, I'm wishing you a speed recovery by the way. So I want to do like a speed role play of the intense stage. I'm on a confidence coaching offer. >> Okay. >> So okay. Is it tangible that would usually give me something like I want to set stronger boundaries or something kind of along those lines? Okay. >> Okay. So I'm assuming it's mainly women you're saying. >> Yeah, mainly women. So you will have to be a rambler. >> Okay. >> I am not I'm not going to put on a woman voice, but I will do my best. >> I have to obviously. So, can you hear and see me? Okay. >> Yeah, I can. >> Good. So, Britney, you told me that you booked this time about possibly wanting, you know, to get some help with increasing your confidence. You could kind of improve the quality of life, feel better, right? So, kind of walk me through what was the main intent or reasoning even possibly reached out for help? Like what's sort of the goal you're after? >> Yeah, I'm looking to like figure out kind of how to set stronger boundaries and be like more confident in myself. >> Uhhuh. I'm confident. Well, kind of. Then my question for you, if that's the goal, what have you seen right now that makes you feel like you don't have enough of that confidence? >> Well, I just feel like I'm a little bit unsure of myself like in relationships and stuff. I don't really know like if I'm doing the right thing or not. >> How often does that happen? >> I would say like fairly often. >> Okay. And has that been going like for a long time or this more of a recent thing? >> Um, it's it's been going on for I mean honestly like not by as long as I really can remember. Not not I guess not at like a specific time frame. >> Okay. So like the like the whole life, right? >> Yeah, I guess so. >> Okay. So if that has been a problem for such a long time, can you kind of walk me through what are you doing right now to actually improve the confidence? >> Um I like meditate and stuff. I'd say that's kind of the main thing in journal. A lot of journaling. >> Okay. For how long have you been doing kind of journaling and meditation? >> Long time. Like five years, something like that. Okay. So, if you've been doing this for five years, then what has shifted now that even made you feel like you actually need some of that outside help to actually get confident? >> I would say I mean like I've tried everything I know so I feel like I kind of need like professional help now. >> Okay. And like what exactly has happened that even made you feel like you need that help? Well, it was I mean like like you mean like a specific like thing that happened? >> Yeah, like a situation. Yeah. >> Um >> I mean I don't know like I noticed like some recent relationships like I couldn't set boundaries and stuff. >> Okay. Can you give me like an example? Can you kind of walk me through it? the guy my I had a friend and I couldn't set boundaries with him so yeah I just didn't feel confident >> okay and kind of do you feel like the fact that you struggle with those boundaries >> okay I'll get I'll get I'll give this is difficult for me I'll give you feedback already that number one inside of intent you're going way too deep >> so it might it might seem like oh they're giving me the answers it's all good and everything and you will usually get answers because if it's a confidence coaching offer, those are usually some of the easiest offers to sell just because of the fact that if they're looking for confidence, it means they're not confident. >> Yeah. >> It's like great, that's pretty easy, right? So, the issue though is a lot of people think, oh, the more pain I get, the better. No, it's not like that at all. So, think about this way. There's a buying pocket, right? And the pocket is like to the point where they realize they have enough pain to where they need help, >> but they're also not so defeated to where they don't even trust their trust. Okay. >> The reason that's so important is because if somebody's underneath that bucket, meaning they have no confidence. They're just like round [ __ ] zero like an infant, it doesn't work because they could think, "Oh, this is the right thing for me to do." But they don't even trust their own decision-m. They don't even trust that they know what a good thing is. >> So, they can never buy. At the same time, if they're too confident, which on your offer, you're never going to have that problem. Then they they think like, "Oh, I have an ego. I don't need help." So, the one that you need to watch out for is you cannot overdefeat people. >> Okay? >> Because that'll [ __ ] you up really bad. And it seems very counterintuitive like, "Oh, I just want more pain." But it's actually not. >> So here's what you do instead. So do not probe as deep an intent. You did a surface level thing like, "Oh, I feel like I can't set boundaries. I lack confidence." Great. Move on. That's all you need. And here's the other key. Whenever people open up with you on offers like that about a lack of confidence, lack of boundaries, whatever. You always have to reaffirm it. >> Okay? >> You always reaffirm it. So this isn't exactly like NLP. I know you know NLP. This isn't exactly NLP. This is more of like kind of pain and plugging principle like more Fodian psychology kind of stuff. But if they give you all this pain of like, oh, this is bad and this is bad and this is bad. Now they're in a TR uh what's what's it called? A [ __ ] forget the technical term, but it's basically in a in a sense of like I can connect better with people now because I'm under stress and under stress obviously you're more receptive. >> And so that's when you reinforce like oh and I appreciate you being so honest. >> Okay. So kind of those >> kudos to you for being like an honest person. Kudos to you for being a strong person. >> Like you label them with the identity because it'll make them more open throughout the rest of the call without defeating them. That's bring them into the bucket. Okay. Can I just Yeah, absolutely. So, just basically allow some surface level answers in the intent. >> Yes. And whenever they start giving you pain, does not matter where in the call it is, always reinforce the identity for your offer. >> Uhhuh. Okay. Would you would you recommend like to ask for example how often you know some specific problem happens like for how long after the >> Yes. But do not ask it in intent. Ask in logical certainty in the probing section. So, when I go, "Oh, well, I couldn't set this boundary with this person and this happened, blah, blah, blah." Then it's like, "Well, how long can that end up?" >> And you have to back that. >> Okay. Thank you. >> Beautiful. Um, I got to run, guys, because I got to go right now. I'm going to go get some help. Brandon, message me offline. Um, I'll help you out like oneonone.
