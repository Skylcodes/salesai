AI Sales Call Practice App — Full Summary
1. Description
A mobile/web app that lets people practice real sales calls with an AI “buyer” that talks back in real-time.
Users can speak naturally, the AI responds like a real person, and the app scores their performance, improves their script, and coaches them on objections.

It simulates real cold calls, discovery calls, appointment settings, and sales conversations — without needing another human.

2. Purpose
The app helps users:

Build confidence talking to prospects

Become better at cold calling and sales conversations

Improve tone, speed, objection handling, and persuasion

The goal is simple:
Help people get better at sales through realistic, personalized practice.
